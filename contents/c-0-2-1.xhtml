            the center oval of the Fractarchy-CMS content pages serves for reading the contents. By dragging its content,
            the content scrolls in dragging direction. Content size isn't restricted, but it is recommended to
            keep it within oval bounds. Scroll bars are not present as they could put graphical appearance
            of the contents out of the ballance.

            On mobile platforms, it is possible to pinch-zoom the content of the central oval for clearer view. Desktop
            platforms provide the same functionality with mouse wheel.
