            hese pages are displayed with Fractarchy-CMS, and they contain Fractarchy-CMS use and site building
            instructions. The current version of Fractarchy-CMS represents a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system" target="_new">headless</a>,
            flat-file, and innovative content management system (CMS). CMS is a software application used to manage
            the creation and modification of digital content. Supported content pages include static HTML, XHTML,
            SVG, PNG, GIF, and JPG files (whatever can be loaded in a web browser).

            When creating a Fractarchy-CMS based site, one should be sure to prepare for a "slack" experience. This means
            one should possess a basic knowledge about editing xml files, html pages, and bitmap or vector graphics by
            third-party tools. Moreover, one should be familiar with usage of local file system, managing a local web
            server, and uploading files to a remote web server. Nevertheless, once one gets into the stunt, maintaining
            sites should be an easy-peasy task.
