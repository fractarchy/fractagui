        <p>
            irst, we need to make sure we have installed a local web server like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache HTTP Server</a>
            project or similar software. We also need to make sure to have an access to a file manager and
            a text editor which we will use to access and edit Fract-exp files.
        </p>
        <p>        
            To install Fract-exp, we have to download the Fract-exp software bundle from
            <a href="https://github.com/contrast-zone/fract-exp">dedicated github pages</a> After downloading
            the software, we have to unpack the downloaded zip archive to a local server folder.
            Unpacking the archive will produce the following file-folder structure:
        </p>
        <p>
<pre><code>
 !
 +-+ Fract-exp-home-folder
   +-+ contents
   ! +-- contents.xml
   ! +-- ...
   !
   +-+ media
   ! +-- ...
   !
   +-+ src
   ! +-- ...
   !
   +-+ info
   ! +-- ...
   !
   +-- index.html
   +-- fract-exp.html
   +-- fract-exp.json
   +-- README.md
   +-- LICENSE
  
</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have unpacked the archive, we can test it by entering the local HTTP server address
            into a web browser. We should be able to see the exact copy of these instructions in the browser.
