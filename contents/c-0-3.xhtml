            3. building fract-exp based site
        </h1>
        <div class="float-left">T</div>
        <p>
            o populate Fract-exp site with custom contents, it is necessary to prepare HTML and graphic files
            representing our pages, to have an access to arbitrary textual editor, and it may be a good practice
            to have a local web server at disposition for testing our new site. Fract-exp represents a so-called flat
            file CMS, meaning there is no need for server side processing, yet all the information needed for
            functioning is extracted only from file-folder structure accessed over HTTP interface. Nevertheless,
            this doesn't mean that Fract-exp is incompatible with server side scripting technologies like ASP, PHP,
            Node.js, and others. In contrary, Fract-exp should collaborate very well with such technologies, as long
            as the output conforms Fract-exp file-folder structures.
