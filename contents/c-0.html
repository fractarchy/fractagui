            hese pages are displayed with FractaGUI, and they contain FractaGUI use and content building instructions.
            The current version of FractaGUI represents an innovative graph based user interface hosting a digital
            content.

        <p>
            When creating a FractaGUI based content, one should possess a basic knowledge about editing XML and XHTML files.
            XML files in FractaGUI define a hierarchical structure of XHTML content files. The structured content is then
            spanned within asymptotic dynamically orbitable and zoomable fractal which can be navigated using mouse or touch
            gestures. Also, some graph styling parameters can be adjusted by editing main JSON file placed in the FractaGUI
            root folder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the entire FractaGUI folder tree may be hosted as a standalone or embedded content at any HTTP address
            space.
