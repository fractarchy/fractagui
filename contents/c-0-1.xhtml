            he latest version of Moonlight loads content element pages on display demand, thus it is
            scalable as long as we have enough RAM at disposition. We should be able to successfuly cope
            with some half a thousand pages per free gigabyte of RAM, depending on particular page sizes.

            However, interaction with pages is reduced only to page panning and following hyperlinks.
            This limitation entails having no fancy event dependent animations or dynamic content tree
            structure. Still, Moonlight could be used in a various scenarios where these limitations
            meet our expectations.
