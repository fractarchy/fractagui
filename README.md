> Do you want to bring a touch of adventurous spirit to your web site? An arbitrary web site made using Fractarchy is not designed so that a visitor comes, sees, leaves, and forgets about it. It is conceived as a brave adventure that the visitor embarks on from the first moment of the visit. Of course, if (s)he wants to, the visitor can also take a look at the very short instructions for navigating the content, but this way your site does not lose its charm. On the contrary, carefully balanced ratio of fun to visit and ease of discovering useful information on your site (prevailing on the entertainment side) provides the visitor with an exceptional experience that leaves a strong impression about your content.

## 1. about fractarchy

Fractarchy is a fractal-structure inspired, parent-child orbiting, and zooming-elements based content management system (CMS). A CMS is a software application that can be used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. Its usual application is building web sites, but it can also be used for other purposes such as organizing data and documentation.

## 2. contents creation

Fractarchy is a kind of headless and flat-file CMS. Composing contents in Fractarchy is consisted of editing external content pages and arranging them using parent-children structure described in a set of XML files. Supported content pages include static HTML, XHTML, SVG, PNG, GIF, and JPG files (whatever can be loaded in a web browser).

## 3. contents navigation

The final result brings all the imported content pages to be shown inside orbitable and zoomable ovals that form a seamless dynamic fractal. We navigate the entire fractal structure using only four kinds of gestures: (1) dragging inside the central oval area to pan its contents, (2) dragging orbiting ovals around the central oval to rotate them, (3) dragging orbiting ovals towards center to zoom them in, or (4) dragging central oval out towards orbit to zoom it out.
