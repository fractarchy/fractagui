            hese pages are displayed with Fractarchy, and they contain Fractarchy use and site building
            instructions. The current version of Fractarchy represents a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system" target="_new">headless</a>,
            flat-file, and innovative content management system (CMS). CMS is a software
            application used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. When using Fractarchy, content
            pages are supposed to be collected from outer resources such as bitmap, vector, and HTML editors, while
            Fractarchy itself manages only tree structuring and browsing the contents. Supported content pages include
            static HTML, XHTML, SVG, PNG, GIF, and JPG files (whatever can be loaded in a web browser).

            When creating a Fractarchy based site, one should be sure to prepare for a "slack" experience. This means
            one should possess a basic knowledge about editing xml files, html pages, and bitmap or vector graphics.
            Moreover, one should be familiar with usage of local file system, managing a local web server, and uploading
            files to a remote web server. Nevertheless, once one gets into the stunt, maintaining sites should be an
            easy-peasy task.
