## 1. about fractarchy-cms

Fractarchy-CMS is a fractal-structure inspired, parent-child orbiting, and zooming-elements based content management system (CMS). A CMS is a software application that can be used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. Its usual application is building web sites, but it can also be used for other purposes such as organizing data and documentation. Fractarchy-CMS is best used in HTML pages where visitors often return, like in a curated selection of web links, searchable hierarchical catalog of arbitrary items, or maybe even some cool mobile content start pages if someone decides to go in PWA (progressive web application) direction.

## 2. contents creation

Fractarchy-CMS is a kind of headless and flat-file CMS. Composing contents in Fractarchy-CMS consists of editing external content pages and arranging them using parent-children structure described in a set of XML files. Supported content pages include static XHTML files.

## 3. contents navigation

The final result brings all the imported content pages to be shown inside orbitable and zoomable ovals that form a seamless dynamic asymptotic fractal. We navigate the entire fractal structure using only five kinds of gestures:

1. dragging inside the central oval area to pan its contents
2. dragging orbiting ovals around the central oval to rotate them
3. dragging orbiting ovals towards center to zoom them in
4. dragging central oval out towards orbit to zoom it out
5. using mouse wheel to switch between navigating and panning mode

These actions are also achievable by clicking arrow buttons in the bottom right screen corner.
