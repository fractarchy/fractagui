        <p>
            o populate Fract-exp site with custom contents, it is necessary to prepare HTML and graphic files
            representing our pages, to have an access to arbitrary textual editor, and it may be a good practice
            to have a local web server at disposition for testing our new site. Fract-exp represents a so-called flat
            file CMS, meaning there is no basic information stored in remote databases, yet all the information needed
            for basic functioning is extracted only from file and folder structure accessed over HTTP interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            To corroborate flat file data system, it is possible to pair it with server side scripting technologies
            like ASP, PHP, Node.js, and others. Fract-exp should collaborate very well with such technologies, as long
            as the outcome conforms Fract-exp file and folder structures.

            Some other more advanced topics that may be shown useful, but for a sake of simplicity will not be covered
            in these short instructions, may include file versioning systems which may operate on Fract-exp contents
            files, and may provide an interesting file keeping arrangement for more advanced Fract-exp users.
