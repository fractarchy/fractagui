            ext, we have to modify the example site to adjust it to our own requirements and introduce
            our own contents instead of the existing one. Freshly unpacked files represent an example site
            containing these instructions we are currently reading. There are several files and folders
            of our interest:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code class="c1" >index.html</code> - this is the main file containing visible project
                    title, a list of SEO keywords, and social media promotional informations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="c1" >fract-exp.html</code> - this file usually won't need to be referenced
                    unless we want override the default <code class="c1" >index.html</code> interface. However,
                    if we want to use use our own layout, we may place the <code class="c1" >fract-exp.html</code>
                    reference inside custom <code class="c1" >iframe</code> structures as a part of user defined
                    <code class="c1" >index.html</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="c1" >fract-exp.json</code> - in this file we can setup various Fract-exp rendering
                    parameters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="c1" >contents/</code> - this is a folder where we keep our site content files.
                    <code class="c1" >contents/contents.feml</code> is the main XML file where we structure the
                    site contents. The site content files (HTML, CSS, images, ...) should all be copied under
                    the same folder and referred from <code class="c1" >contents/contents.feml</code> file.
                    Actually, the content files may be structured in any folders, but it is recommended to place
                    the entire structure under <code class="c1" >contents/</code> folder. That would keep our
                    site clean and tidy.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hopefully, examining the default site example (that is, these instructions) should be descriptive
            enough to compose our own site. This is the quirky part where we will be using
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager">file manager</a>
            and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor">text editor</a>
            to arrange and edit files of our interst. Please refer to provided links if you need to get more
            familiar with mentioned notions. This procedure is what makes Fract-exp site creating experience
            "slack", and requires a bit more advanced knowledge from the site creators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon each edit, we would want to test if changes we made reflect what we want them to be. Again, we
            can test them by entering the local HTTP server address into a web browser.<br/>
