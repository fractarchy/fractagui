            hese pages are displayed with Fract-exp (fractal expression), and they contain Fract-exp use and site building
            instructions. The current version of Fract-exp represents a headless, flat-file, light, and innovative content
            management system. Content management system (CMS) is a software application used to manage the creation and
            modification of digital content. When using Fract-exp, content pages are supposed to be collected from outer
            resources such as bitmap, vector, and HTML editors, while Fract-exp itself manages only tree structuring and
            browsing the contents. Supported content pages include static HTML, XHTML, SVG, PNG, GIF, and JPG files.

            When creating an Fract-exp based site, one should be sure to prepare for a "slack" experience. This means
            one should possess a basic knowledge about editing xml files, html pages, and bitmap or vector graphics.
            Moreover, one should be familiar with usage of local file system, managing a local web server, and uploading
            files to a remote web server. Nevertheless, once one gets into the stunt, maintaining the site should be an
            easy-peasy task.
